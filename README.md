# Smart Contract audits
This repo includes a list of some example Smart Contract audits that I have done since getting into Web3 offensive security in 2021. Each item will include the firm under which it was published and the URL of the public report if available. 
* [Oak Security](https://www.oaksecurity.io/): August 2022 - now
* [Halborn](https://halborn.com/): October 2021 - June 2022

**Disclaimer:** all Oak Security audits are performed in teams of three (that's why they are so good!). Therefore, authorship of both findings and report are shared with two additional brilliant individuals.
